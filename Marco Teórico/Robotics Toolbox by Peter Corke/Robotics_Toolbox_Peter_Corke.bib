	abstract = {For 25 years the Robotics Toolbox for {MATLAB} R has been used for teaching and research worldwide. This paper describes its successor – the Robotics Toolbox for Python. More than just a port, it takes advantage of popular opensource packages and resources to provide platform portability, fast browser-based 3D graphics, quality documentation, fast numerical and symbolic operations, powerful {IDEs}, shareable and web-browseable notebooks all powered by {GitHub} and the open-source community. The new Toolbox provides wellknown functionality for spatial mathematics (homogeneous transformations, quaternions, triple angles and twists), trajectories, kinematics (zeroth to second order), dynamics and a rich assortment of robot models. In addition, we’ve taken the opportunity to add new capabilities such as branched mechanisms, collision checking, {URDF} import, and interfaces to {CoppeliaSim}, {ROS} and Dynamixel servomotors. With familiar, simple yet powerful functions; the clarity of Python syntax; but without the complexity of {ROS}; users from beginner to advanced will ﬁnd this a powerful open-source toolset for ongoing robotics education and research.},
