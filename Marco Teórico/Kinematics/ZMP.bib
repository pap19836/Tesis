	abstract = {The control of a biped humanoid is a challenging task due to the hard-to-stabilize dynamics. Walking reference trajectory generation is a key problem. Linear Inverted Pendulum Model ({LIPM}) and Zero Moment Point ({ZMP}) Criterion-based approaches in stable walking reference generation are reported. In these methods, generally, the {ZMP} reference during a stepping motion is kept ﬁxed in the middle of the supporting foot sole. This kind of reference generation lacks naturalness, in that the {ZMP} in the human walk does not stay ﬁxed, but it moves forward under the supporting foot. This paper proposes a reference generation algorithm based on the {LIPM} and moving support foot {ZMP} references. The application of Fourier series approximation simpliﬁes the solution, and it generates a smooth {ZMP} reference. A simple inverse kinematics-based joint space controller is used for the tests of the developed reference trajectory through full-dynamics 3-D simulation. A 12-{DOF} biped robot model is used in the simulations. Simulation studies suggest that the moving {ZMP} references are more energy efﬁcient than the ones with ﬁxed {ZMP} under the supporting foot. The results are promising for implementations.},
